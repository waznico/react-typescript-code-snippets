# React Typescript Code Snippets
This is my personal selection of code snippets I often use, when working with React in Typescript. Feel free to clone,
add, fork or share thiese.

## What is it exactly?
This json document contains code snippets you can use in Visual Studio Code for quick typing generic constructs of code
(i. e. a for-loop or a function component).

## Installation
It's a global snippet so you have to copy it to the config directory of VS Code. In Linux it's 
`~/.config/Code/User/snippets/`.

## Contribution
You can add issues or create some code by your own and pushing it to the project.
